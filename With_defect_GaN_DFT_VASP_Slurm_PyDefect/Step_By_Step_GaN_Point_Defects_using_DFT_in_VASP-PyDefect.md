## This entire step-by-step guide is a simplified and comprehensive guide to generating point defect formation energy using the PyDefect package [[Official site](https://kumagai-group.github.io/pydefect/index.html)] and VASP. 
* All the issues related to implementing the codes have been solved here. You can just copy and paste the codes with your own materials, and it should work perfectly. Here, I am using GaN as an example. 
* If you are new to VASP, please first go to the "GaN_Point_Defect_Investigation_with_DFT_VASP-PyDefect/Without_defect_GaN_DFT_VASP_Slurm" directory to become familiar with it.
